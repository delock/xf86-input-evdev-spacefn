This fork provides an implementation of SpaceFn in xf86-input-evdev.

    "The SpaceFN layout: trying to end keyboard inflation"
    https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51069.0

The idea of SpaceFn is to let the space key work as both a regular
space and a modifier. The implementation needs to sometimes store away
keypresses, and then emit keypresses and releases once it's clear
whether space is being used as space or as a modifier. The logic is
quite complex and not perfect yet.

Generally, when space is held, the implementation emits a keypress for
the menu key (keycode 0x87) before other keys and a release of the
menu key after. It's up to you to make the menu key a modifier in your
xmodmap and make modified keys do something useful. I have this:

    keycode 135 = Mode_switch Mode_switch Mode_switch Mode_switch
    keycode  43 = h H Left Left
    keycode  44 = j J Down Down
    keycode  45 = k K Up Up
    keycode  46 = l L Right Right
    keycode  56 = b B space space
    keycode  57 = n N Next Next
    keycode  58 = m M Prior Prior
    keycode  30 = u U Home Home
    keycode  32 = o O End End
