This fork provides an implementation of SpaceFn in xf86-input-evdev.

    "The SpaceFN layout: trying to end keyboard inflation"
    https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51069.0

The idea of SpaceFn is to let the space key work as both a regular
space and a modifier. For more information about the implementation
and how to build, install, and configure it, see
